/**
 * Figma "Bg pattern" (1:1307) — the ruled grid every other element sits on.
 *
 * Split in two because Figma builds it in two different boxes: the row frame
 * (1:1315) is 1440 wide and the column frame (1:1308) is only 370. Rows
 * therefore bleed the full viewport while columns stay inside the phone stage —
 * which is also what keeps the rules meeting both screen edges no matter how
 * wide the window gets.
 *
 * Both rules carry Figma's 1px white offset shadow; that highlight is what
 * gives them their engraved edge against the #f5f5f5 field.
 *
 * Tablet (1:855) re-pitches rather than scales: rows go 73 -> 127 and start at
 * -86 instead of -50, and the column band moves in to 52/56 from the frame
 * edges. Neither is the phone grid multiplied by anything.
 *
 * Desktop (1:2145) drops to a 101px pitch on both axes and widens the column
 * band to 63 -> 1376, which is 14 rules rather than 6. All 14 are rendered and
 * the extra 8 are hidden below `desktop-sm`, so `justify-between` spreads
 * whichever ones are showing — 6 evenly on phone, 14 evenly on desktop.
